# Amazon-Fine-Food-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

Analyze sentiment in Amazon Fine Food Reviews using VADER and RoBERTa Pretrained Model.

## Overview

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of Amazon Fine Food Reviews using two different approaches: VADER sentiment analysis and the RoBERTa pretrained model. By comparing the results from these two methods, we gain insights into the differences and strengths of each approach in analyzing sentiment.

## Key Components:

- Data Collection: A dataset containing 500 Amazon Fine Food Reviews was gathered for analysis. Each review included information such as star ratings, review text, and sentiment labels.

- Sentiment Analysis with VADER: The VADER sentiment analysis tool, known for its rule-based approach, was employed to assess the sentiment of each review. VADER assigned compound scores to quantify sentiment intensity.

- Sentiment Analysis with RoBERTa: RoBERTa, a deep learning-based model, was utilized to perform sentiment analysis on the same set of reviews. It categorized sentiments into positive, neutral, and negative categories.

- Visualization: A range of data visualizations, including bar charts and scatter plots, were created to illustrate the distribution of sentiment scores across different star ratings and to compare the results obtained from VADER and RoBERTa.

- Insights and Speculations: Insights were derived from the visualizations to speculate on patterns in sentiment expressions within the dataset, the relationship between star ratings and sentiment, and the potential implications for businesses.

## Significance:

- This project demonstrates proficiency in natural language processing and sentiment analysis techniques, showcasing the ability to employ both rule-based and deep learning-based approaches.
- It highlights the importance of understanding sentiment in customer reviews for businesses seeking to make data-driven decisions and enhance customer satisfaction.
- By comparing VADER and RoBERTa results, it showcases the differences between rule-based and machine learning-based sentiment analysis, emphasizing the advantages and limitations of each approach.

## Conclusion:

This sentiment analysis project not only provides valuable insights into customer sentiment within a dataset of Amazon Fine Food Reviews but also showcases the ability to leverage different sentiment analysis techniques. By presenting the results through clear visualizations and drawing insights from them, this project demonstrates a data-driven approach to understanding customer sentiment, which can be applied to various domains and industries.
